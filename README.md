# Network Security Projects (Python)

These are a collections of projects/code used in various applications ranging from embedded systems to SAAS applications. 

## Introduction

As an adjunct instructor I typically am asked by students of how python programming is used by a security engineer. The following projects are examples of code written to support various phases of the penetration testing illustrated below
1. Reconaissance
2. Scanning
3. Lateral Movement (Pivoting)
4. Exploitation


### Reconaissance\Scanning

Examples of code
* pingsweeper.py - scan a network for live systems
* portscanner.py - for a given host scan all ports
